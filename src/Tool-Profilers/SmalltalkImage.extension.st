	The argument is the number of interrupt checks (method activations) to let go by before taking a sample. The sample is being stored in the profileSample iVar which can be retrieved by executing primitiveProfileSample. When a sample is taken, it signals the semaphore specified in primitiveProfileSemaphore.
