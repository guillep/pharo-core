I create repositories. 
I do this (trying in this order):

- with a location and url defined, I check if it can be a repository and in positive case, I answer the repository, or I can do a clone+checkout (into location) and answer the resulting repository.
- with a remote defined , I can take url and location and perform the correct actions.

You can also define  branchName to checkout a specific branch.
